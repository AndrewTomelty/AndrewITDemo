<h1>A Little Background Information About Myself</h1>
<p>My name is Andrew Tomelty, born on the 9th of March 1999. My early childhood was spent in the city of Melbourne where I began my primary school education. In 2005, my parents decided to move to a place called Daly River, a town situated approximately 300kms from the city of Darwin, in the Northern Territory. It was in Daly River where I grew up to become the person I am today. In October of 2015, my family and I returned to Melbourne, in order for my older brother and I to complete VCE and attend university.</p>
  
<h1>My Education</h1> 

<p>I completed VCE, graduating in 2016 from Copperfield College. Currently I am a student at RMIT University, undertaking a Bachelor of Business with a major in Economics and Finance.</p>
  
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
 
<p>As a business student, I am continuously looking to expand my knowledge into different areas which are able to aid me throughout my business degree. IT has always been an interest of mine, but not something that I was able to partake in learning about up until this point of my life.</p>

<p>My first time going to RMIT was the Open Day which I went to during my final year of high-school. After the opening day I knew RMIT was my university of choice as I was joining a vibrant and welcoming university recognised for its innovation in technology, design and enterprise.</p>

<p>During my studies I hope to learn the skills I need to get my dream job after I finish my degree. </p>
