<h1>A Little Background Information About Myself</h1>
<p>My name is Andrew Tomelty, born on the 9th of March 1999. My early childhood was spent in the city of Melbourne where I began my primary school education. In 2005, my parents decided to move to a place called Daly River, a town situated approximately 300kms from the city of Darwin, in the Northern Territory. It was in Daly River where I grew up to become the person I am today. In October of 2015, my family and I returned to Melbourne, in order for my older brother and I to complete VCE and attend university.</p>
  
<h1>My Education</h1> 

<p>I completed VCE, graduating in 2016 from Copperfield College. Currently I am a student at RMIT University, undertaking a Bachelor of Business with a major in Economics and Finance.</p>
  
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
 
<p>As a business student, I am continuously looking to expand my knowledge into different areas which are able to aid me throughout my business degree. IT has always been an interest of mine, but not something that I was able to partake in learning about up until this point of my life.</p>

<p>My first time going to RMIT was the Open Day which I went to during my final year of high-school. After the opening day I knew RMIT was my university of choice as I was joining a vibrant and welcoming university recognised for its innovation in technology, design and enterprise.</p>

<p>During my studies I hope to learn the skills I need to get my dream job after I finish my degree. </p>

<h1>Personal Profile</h1>

<p>These personality and learning tests have provided me with more in-depth characteristics of my personality type. The results support what I already believed to know about myself and my personality.</p>

<p>The results would influence my behaviour to use my strengths, according to my personality, when working in a team.</p>

<p>An effective team should be great at communicating, should be diverse, should focus on their goals, offer support and should be able to have fun. Under these qualities, a team should be made up of people with diversified personalities in order for it to be effective</p>

<h1>My Project Idea</h1>

<p>In todayâ€™s modern era, the use of mobile phones has become a necessity rather than a luxury. As the need for services grows there has become an increase in the demand for applications, or apps, to manage our lifestyles. My idea for a project would be to develop an application that allows for maintenance companies to offer their services via an app that works through a price, rating and location service. Similar to the use of the app Uber, maintenance companies would be able to offer their services through an app, which people can use to order maintenance, rate their experience with the company and be able to pay securely through the app.</p>
  
<p>My motivation for this project was that if an app like this were to be developed, it would make it easier for people to manage their everyday issues easily. Furthermore, through the use of a rating and pricing system, people would be able to compare the effectiveness of different maintenance companies and their prices in order to find which company suits them best. Furthermore, an app such as this would be able to make a profit by taking a percentage off transactions made through the app.</p>

<p>There are many features required when creating an app for a product or service. In order to make the app for the product described here useful, practical, intuitive and easy to use there are essential features which need to be included. Firstly, this app would need to be developed for all platforms and mobile phone developers. For users to receive a great experience with the app, the range of sizes of phones and tablets would need to be considered in order to make a responsive design for varying screen sizes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as previously stated, this app would include a pricing, rating and location feature. These features would ensure the consumer is receiving the best experience possible on the app, but also feel in control when choosing the services they require. 
Through the use of a pricing system, companies would be able to compare the prices of their services compared to their competitors. Moreover, users of the service would be quoted their service fees with a list of competitors prices available to them to ensure they are paying the price of their choice.</p>

<p>The rating service would also provide consumers with an instant-feedback model where other consumers would be able to review the highest-rated services available to them, provided by other consumers.</p>

<p>Finally, the location service is the infrastructure that would enable users to identify their current physical location in the word. The GPS and cellular systems are used to pinpoint longitude and attitude of users, providing their location to the service provider they have chosen.</p>

<p>Another feature that this app would include would be a search feature. The search bar feature would give users a way to find the services they require quickly and with ease. As this app requires a lot of content, it can easily become cumbersome and unusable. To avoid this, the app would include a search feature to locate content that contains keywords relevant to the content which they are looking for.</p>

<p>The foundation for an application such as this would be code and data, however, there would need to a platform to power the app. The code that could be used to level the app would most likely be Python, Node,js or Java. When high performance needs to be ensured, a code language such as Java will most likely need to be used. These codes would help power the service and create the app. Storage would also have to be taken into account when working with data. The use of a cloud system could help to solve this issue.</p>

<p>There are many skills required in order to make this project a reality. For example, there would be a need for a person fluent in coding languages (such as Python, Java, C++) in order to help develop the app. The hardware needed for the development would not be incredibly difficult to acquire due to the extensive demand for app creation. For an app of this type, it would be very feasible to begin to create through the knowledge of developers who are able to provide support in different areas of the progression of the project.</p>

<p>If this project were to be successful, it would aid in helping people manage a task, which can often take a large amount of time, in a quick and easy fashion, where the information provided to them is from other consumers. Not only would this app be able to benefit consumers, but it would also benefit the companies providing their service. Through the use of the app, maintenance would be easily available to every person with the app, and providers would be easily able to provide their services to a direct market of people who are looking for maintenance.</p>

<p>Although developing this project would help people find the services they require, there can also be drawbacks to developing an app. To begin with, apps can be expensive and have lengthy development periods. The more functionality an app requires, the more they cost to create. If an app does not become successful, it can cause the developers become unable to generate profits for their business. 
Another drawback of developing an app of this type would be giving companies incentive to provide their services. The whole premise of the app is that services are provided to consumers. If no company wishes to provide their services on the app, then it would not be feasible to develop the app further. Likewise, if consumers do not find the app useful and practical it would prevent it from developing further.</p>
